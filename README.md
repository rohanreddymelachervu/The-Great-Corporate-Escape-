# THE GREAT OFFICE ESCAPE: 4:59 PM — Ruleset 2

> You've finished your work. Unfortunately, nobody else has.

A client-side Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite office-escape game. No backend, account, database, runtime AI, API key, tracker or paid gameplay service.

**Preview:** https://hyperagent.com/s/0RA76fgitXB1NI7B7D0-mA

**Deployable GitHub Pages build:** `docs/index.html` on `main`. The source and rebuilt `docs` are committed to the existing `rohanreddymelachervu/The-Great-Corporate-Escape-` repository. This update does not change hosting settings; redeploy your existing Pages setup from that folder.

## This is a different gameplay loop

The old compulsory badge-and-switch errands are gone. You already have your own ID.

1. **Follow the gold arrow to the lift. Press E to call it.**
2. **Survive the office while it arrives.** HR attempts photo charges, moving photo sweeps cross your lane, and meetings, intern yap, paperwork and all-hands announcements create marked danger zones. Badge pings draw colleagues toward a snapshot of your last position.
3. **Board before the doors close.** The lift opens for ten seconds. Miss it and another arrives in fourteen seconds; missing one is not an arbitrary instant loss.

The first floor already has both the manager and HR. **DODGE HR · QUICK PLAY** jumps directly into the HR floor. The optional rhythm activity remains at office booths and under **CLAP PRACTICE**; it is not a substitute for the escape game.

Lift waits are 20 / 26 / 30 / 34 / 38 seconds across the five floors. Side switches are optional tactics: sabotage the main nuisance, cancel matching interference and bring the lift up to seven seconds sooner. WFH tokens on later floors enable a real alternative exit.

## The interference has counterplay

- **HR photo charge:** HR stops, draws a pink locked-aim line, then lunges at that recorded position. Dodge sideways. She cannot home during the charge or go through furniture.
- **Pink photo sweep:** a warning lane precedes the moving beam. Step out of its lane or time a dodge through it.
- **Orange meeting zone:** move away before the calendar circle arms.
- **Purple yap:** leave the marked ring. The intern also moves quickly and slows nearby employees with his monologue.
- **Friday paperwork:** stacks cross a telegraphed path. Move aside, use cover or dodge.
- **Founder All Hands:** get out of the gold circle. The whistle redirects the office and expands awareness temporarily. The founder ignores fake calls.
- **Manager / PM:** catching you during a lift wait can add a one-time four / three second delay respectively. They cannot delay it forever.
- **Gossip:** discovery broadcasts your last known position to nearby colleagues.

All hazards have a warning before activation. Walls and solid furniture block line of sight and hazard contact. A hazard can damage you once, not every frame. Dodging does not permit walking through desks. Remaining inside an armed circle after a dash can still hurt.

Getting caught builds **Corporate BS**. At 100%, you are promoted to staying late. Physical catches grant a three-second escape grace period. Coffee pickups, pantry breaks and brief hiding provide recovery.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Touch |
|---|---|---|
| Move | WASD / arrows | Joystick |
| Sprint | Hold Shift | Hold RUN |
| Dodge | Space | DASH |
| Call lift / use a nearby tool / hide | E | ACT |
| Throw coffee ahead | 1 | COFFEE |
| Fake client call | 2 | CLIENT CALL |
| Stationary Slack camouflage | 3 | BUSY |
| Calendar blocker | 4 | CALENDAR |
| VPN disconnect | 5 | VPN |
| Emergency WFH approval | 6 | WFH |
| Pause | Escape / pause button | Pause button |
| Mute | M / sound button | Sound button |

**Space is a dodge, not an interaction.** It costs 18 stamina, lasts 0.19 seconds and has a 1.7-second cooldown. Walk or refill coffee to recover stamina. Sprint exhaustion uses a recovery latch rather than jittering between speeds.

Coffee now diverts **at most two nearby colleagues**, and a close pursuer who still sees you only hesitates. Break sight and throw around cover. It is not a group invisibility button.

Fake calls last five seconds and slow your movement; founder and intern ignore them. Calendar immunity lasts 3.5 seconds. VPN clears live hazards and stops enemies for two seconds while the lift continues coming. Camouflage requires remaining stationary. Tools unlock progressively by floor.

Purple hide spots offer **six seconds of cover**, then expire and need a cooldown. You cannot hide through an entire lift wait. Hiding, pantry coffee and optional sabotage are useful choices rather than mandatory fetch steps.

The HUD, map and controls occupy separate grid regions. Only the current objective and one nearby NPC speaker are shown. Portrait and landscape touch layouts retain the same rules. Audio starts after a gesture and provides separate music/SFX volume controls and mute. Reduced-motion settings disable camera shake and dash ghosts. Losing focus pauses the run.

## Optional HR Fun Friday

At pink booths on floors 2, 4 and 5, use E to play **Clap for the Culture**. Read the instruction, then press Start Activity. Land three of five claps in the mint timing zone to get −25 BS, one coffee, twelve seconds of HR distraction and accuracy points. Failure adds eight BS. Booths are single-use per floor.

The office simulation pauses while the activity runs, including the lift; the activity's time is added to your score clock. Menu practice has its own local best and does not change campaign progress.

## Scores and replay

The base score rewards time, never being spotted/caught, laptop recovery, limited credited distractions and low final BS. Each actual hazard/HR-charge dodge adds **125 points**; HR activity adds twice its accuracy points. Bronze, Silver, Gold and Ghost Employee medals, local personal bests, thirteen achievements and UTC-seeded daily challenges remain available.

A failed run and pause-menu restart retain their opening seed, so retries let you learn rather than rerolling the problem. Replays after a win can vary. Old unlocks, achievements and audio settings are preserved; ruleset-2 campaign and daily scores use separate keys so old nine-second fetch-route records do not dominate the new game. There is no server leaderboard, anti-cheat or cloud save.

## Build and test

Node 22+ and npm. No secrets or environment configuration are required.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Vite serves development on port 4173. That development address is not a public deployment.

Build outputs:
- `dist/`: ordinary static hosting output.
- `release/office-escape.html`: portable offline single-file game.
- `docs/index.html` and `docs/.nojekyll`: the same game prepared for branch-based GitHub Pages. `docs` is intentionally committed.

The approximately 1.94 MB uncompressed release contains Phaser, fonts, artwork code, audio code and legal notices. The large-chunk warning is expected: runtime CDN dependency was deliberately avoided.

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
npm run test:release
npm run test:campaign
```

`CHROMIUM_PATH` optionally selects an existing Chromium executable. Otherwise Playwright uses its managed browser.

- **460 unit/data tests:** geometry, navigation, saves, RNG, maps, sixty-three encounter-director checks, seventy-two enemy checks, HR rhythm logic and legacy-score migration.
- **21 browser journeys:** actual keyboard and touch dodges, arrow/WASD movement, windup/locked-aim behavior, warnings before hits, real hazard dodge credit, camping consequences, lift timing/boarding, optional sabotage, recovery, alternative WFH, loss/retry, settings, daily seed, responsive bounds and HR activity success/failure.
- **Three offline production checks:** desktop plus portrait/landscape touch startup, input, dodge, coffee and pause with network disabled and no production QA helpers.
- **Real-input production campaign:** the map-aware controller plays all five floors without positioning, health, timer or win hooks. It can attempt a floor at most three times, using actual optional sabotage after a failed attempt; failures are recorded, not hidden. Focused development runs may explicitly skip unlocks, but full production runs do not.

The previous Space/arrow default-prevention bug was found through browser input tests and fixed. See `QA-REPORT.md` for the actual final run evidence. Passing automated tests proves functionality, not that every person will find the game fun; more human playtesting remains valuable.

## Architecture

```
src/main.ts                  Menus, input, overlays, progression and lifecycle
src/game/scene.ts            Fixed-step run, movement, abilities, lift interaction, effects
src/game/director.ts         Pure seeded interference, warning/hit rules, lift/boarding clock

```

Phaser Canvas is intentional for reliable software/mobile rendering. Static office illustrations are baked once. Dynamic hazards are bounded in number, navigation is refreshed at controlled intervals, and gameplay uses a fixed 60 Hz step.

`window.__office.snapshot()` is read-only inspection for QA. Positioning and seeded-start helpers exist only in Vite development mode with `?qa=1`; they are absent in the production release.

## Redeploy GitHub Pages

Use your existing repository and Pages setup. Pull the updated `main` branch and redeploy **`/docs`**. No new repository, account, workflow secret, API token or database is needed. This update does not alter repository visibility or hosting settings.

If setting up Pages for the first time, GitHub Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` → `/docs` → Save. Use the actual HTTPS address GitHub returns. A GitHub Pages deployment is not claimed merely because build files were committed.

Future updates: build, test and commit both source and regenerated `docs/index.html`. Other static hosts can serve `dist`; `wrangler.toml` remains an optional Cloudflare configuration without credentials.

## Licenses and remaining limits

Original sprites, office art, dialogue, layouts, sound and music are generated locally. Application source is MIT licensed. Phaser's MIT notice and Barlow Condensed / IBM Plex Mono SIL Open Font License notices are preserved in `licenses`, hosted builds and the portable file. No remote image/audio/font service is required during play.

Physical iOS/Android hardware and Safari/Firefox have not been tested. Daily competition and saves remain local/honor-system. Characters use expressive static sprites, bob/flip movement and dash ghosts rather than full directional animation sheets. This is a compact arcade-stealth survival game, not a long narrative RPG. A map-aware controller clears floors faster than a first-time exploratory player; pacing and subjective enjoyment still need human feedback.
